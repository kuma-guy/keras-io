# Keras 3 benchmarks

We benchmark the three backends of Keras 3
([TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/),
[JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/))
alongside native PyTorch implementations ([HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)
and [Meta Research](https://github.com/facebookresearch/)) and alongside Keras 2
with TensorFlow. Find code and setup details for reproducing our results
[here](https://github.com/haifeng-jin/keras-benchmarks/tree/v0.0.4).

## Models

We chose a set of popular computer vision and natural language processing models
for both generative and non-generative AI tasks. See the table below for our
selections.

**Table 1**: Models used in benchmarking.

| | Non-Generative | Generative |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| CV | SegmentAnything<sup>1</sup> | StableDiffusion<sup>2</sup> |
| NLP | BERT<sup>3</sup> | Gemma<sup>4</sup>, Mistral<sup>5</sup> |

We leveraged pre-existing implementations from KerasCV and KerasNLP for the
Keras versions of the models. For native PyTorch, we opted for the most popular
options online:

* BERT, Gemma, Mistral from HuggingFace Transformers
* StableDiffusion from HuggingFace Diffusers
* SegmentAnything from the original PyTorch implementation by Meta Research

We'll refer to this group as "Native PyTorch" in contrast to Keras 3 with
PyTorch backend.

We employed synthetic data for all benchmarks. We used `bfloat16` precision for
all LLM training and inferencing, and LoRA<sup>6</sup> for all LLM training
(fine-tuning). Based on the recommendations of the PyTorch team, we used
`torch.compile(model, mode="reduce-overhead")` with native PyTorch
implementations to compile the models.

To measure out-of-the-box performance, we use high-level APIs (e.g. `Trainer()`
from HuggingFace, plain PyTorch training loops and Keras `model.fit()`) with as
little configuration as possible. Note that this is quite different from
measuring an optimized implementation for a particular hardware/framework/model
combination.

## Hardware

All benchmarks are done with a single NVIDIA A100 GPU with 40GB of GPU memory on
a Google Cloud Compute Engine of machine type `a2-highgpu-1g` with 12 vCPUs and
85GB host memory.

## Results

Table 2 displays benchmarking results in milliseconds per step. Each step
involves training or predicting on a single data batch. Results are averaged
over 100 steps, excluding the first, which includes model creation and
compilation overhead.

For fair comparison, we use the same batch size across frameworks if it is the
same model and task (fit or predict). However, for different models and tasks,
due to their different sizes and architectures, we use different batch sizes to
avoid either running out of memory (too large) or under GPU utilization (too
small). A too small batch size would also unfairly make PyTorch look slow due to
its Python overhead.

For large language models (Gemma and Mistral), we also used the same batch size
since they are the same model type with similar number of parameters (7B). We
also benchmarked text generation with batch size equal to 1 since it is widely
requested by the users.

better.

\* _LLM inference with the PyTorch backend is abnormally slow at this time
because KerasNLP uses static sequence padding, unlike HuggingFace. This will be
addressed soon._

## Discussion

### Key Finding 1: There is no "best" backend

Each of the three backends of Keras offers unique strengths. Crucially, from a
performance standpoint, there's no single backend that consistently outpaces the
others. The fastest backend often depends on your specific model architecture.

This underscores the value of framework optionality when chasing optimal
performance. Keras 3 empowers you to seamlessly switch backends, ensuring you
find the ideal match for your model.

### Key Finding 2: Keras 3 is consistently faster than the reference PyTorch implementations 

The following figure compares the best-performing Keras 3 backend for each model
with the corresponding reference native PyTorch implementation. We calculated
the throughput (steps/ms) increase of Keras 3 over native PyTorch from Table 2.
A 100% increase indicates Keras 3 is twice as fast, while 0% means both
frameworks perform equally.

**Figure 1**: Keras 3 speedup over PyTorch measured in throughput (steps/ms)

Keras 3 with the best-performing backend outperformed the reference native
PyTorch implementations for all the models. Notably, 5 out of 10 tasks
demonstrated speedups exceeding 50%, with a maximum speedup of 290%.

### Key Finding 3: Keras 3 delivers best-in-class "out-of-the-box" performance

All Keras model implementations benchmarked here are plain implementations
without any custom performance optimizations: they represent "out-of-the-box
performance", the kind of performance that any Keras user should expect for
their own models. While, for native PyTorch implementations, more performance
optimizations are expected on the user's side.

Besides the numbers we shared above, we observed a significant performance boost
(over 100%) in HuggingFace Diffusers' StableDiffusion inferencing between
versions `0.3.0` and `0.25.0` (the version used in our benchmarks). Gemma in
HuggingFace Transformers also has a significant improvement from `4.38.1` to
`4.38.2` (the version used in our benchmarks). These performance improvements
underscore HuggingFace's dedicated engineering efforts toward performance
optimization.

Conversely, consider a less manually-optimized model like SegmentAnything, where
we used the implementation provided by the research authors. Here, the
performance gap compared to Keras is wider than most other models.

The takeaway here is that Keras offers exceptional out-of-the-box performance.
You don't have to know all the tricks to make your model run faster.

### Key Finding 4: Keras 3 is faster than Keras 2

We also calculated the throughput (steps/ms) increase of Keras 3 (using its
best-performing backend) over Keras 2 with TensorFlow from Table 1. Results are
shown in the following figure.

![Figrue 2](https://i.imgur.com/jPncf0F.png)

**Figure 2**: Keras 3 speedup over Keras 2 measured in throughput (steps/ms)

Keras 3 consistently outperformed Keras 2 across all benchmarked models, with
substantial speed increases in many cases. SegmentAnything inference saw a
remarkable 380% boost, StableDiffusion training throughput increased by over
150%, and BERT training throughput rose by over 100%.

Importantly, you would still see a performance boost even if you simply upgrade
to Keras 3 and continue using the TensorFlow backend. This is mainly because
Keras 2 uses more TensorFlow fused ops directly, which may be sub-optimal for
XLA compilation in certain use cases.


## Conclusions

Framework performance depends heavily on the specific model. Keras 3 empowers
you to select the fastest framework for your task â€“ an option almost always to
outperform both Keras 2 and reference PyTorch implementations. Importantly,
Keras 3 models deliver excellent out-of-the-box performance without requiring
complex, low-level optimizations.
